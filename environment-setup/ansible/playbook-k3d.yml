# ---------------------------------------
# k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s 
# (Rancher Labâ€™s minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker.
# k3d makes it very easy to create single- and multi-node k3s
# clusters in docker, e.g. for local development on Kubernetes.
# It's a great tool to students learn about Kubernets.
#
# The main problem in using k3d at this course is because in order
# to enable some K8s features in k3d like port expose and volume points
# we need to enable it in cluster creation. 
#
# For instance, to create a cluster in k3d that will, in the future, have an service 
# that exposes host's 8082 port we need to run : 
# 
#   k3d cluster create mycluster -p "8082:30080@agent:0" --agents 2 
#
# See official documentation: https://k3d.io/v5.4.6/usage/exposing_services/
# 
# Similar to that, to enable volume points:
# 
#   k3d cluster create mycluster -v /my/path@agent:0
#
